Specifically, I examined:\n\nmrm2: Months since the last donation,\nfreq: Number of prior donations,\nyears: Years since the donor’s first contribution.\n\nBoth t-tests and linear regressions were conducted. The results show no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the variables (all p-values &gt; 0.05). For example, the p-value for the difference in mrm2 is 0.905.\nThis confirms what Table 1 of the original paper shows: the random assignment mechanism appears to have worked well, with balanced covariates between the two groups."

    "section": "Experimental Results",
    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\nThe figure below shows the proportion of individuals who made a donation, comparing those in the treatment group (who received a matching offer) versus the control group.\n\nimport pandas as  pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('karlan_list_2007.dta')\n# Calculate donation rate for treatment and control groups\ndonation_rates = df.groupby('treatment')['gave'].mean()\nlabels = ['Control', 'Treatment']\nrates = [donation_rates[0], donation_rates[1]]\n\n# Create the barplot\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.bar(labels, rates)\nplt.ylabel('Proportion Donated')\nplt.title('Donation Rate by Treatment Group')\nplt.ylim(0, max(rates) * 1.2)\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo statistically assess whether matched donations increase the likelihood of giving, I ran a t-test comparing the proportion of individuals who donated in the treatment and control groups. The test reveals a significant difference (t = 3.10, p = 0.0019), indicating that individuals who received a matching offer were more likely to contribute.\nTo confirm this result, I also ran a bivariate linear regression where the dependent variable is whether the individual donated (gave), and the independent variable is treatment assignment. The estimated coefficient on treatment is approximately 0.004, meaning that being in the treatment group increases the probability of giving by about 0.4 percentage points. This result is statistically significant at the 1% level.\n\nimport pandas as  pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('karlan_list_2007.dta')\n# Split the data into treatment and control groups\ngave_treat = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_control = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['gave']\n\n# Run a t-test\nt_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(gave_treat, gave_control)\n\n# Run a bivariate linear regression: gave ~ treatment\nreg_model = smf.ols('gave ~ treatment', data=df).fit()\nreg_summary = reg_model.summary()\n\nt_stat, p_val, reg_summary.tables[1]\n\n(3.101361000543946,\n 0.0019274025949016986,\n &lt;class 'statsmodels.iolib.table.SimpleTable'&gt;)\n\n\nThese findings suggest that even small psychological incentives—like knowing your donation will be matched—can motivate action. Humans are responsive not only to absolute costs and benefits, but also to social cues and perceived multipliers of their impact.\nTo replicate Table 3, column (1) from the original paper, I estimated a probit regression model where the outcome variable is whether a charitable donation was made, and the explanatory variable is treatment assignment. The coefficient on the treatment indicator is 0.197, statistically significant at the 1% level (p = 0.002). This suggests that being offered a matching grant increases the probability of donation in a statistically significant way, consistent with the authors’ original finding.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Reload the data\ndata_path = \"karlan_list_2007.dta\"\ndf = pd.read_stata(data_path)\n\n# Run a probit regression: gave ~ treatment\nprobit_model = smf.probit('gave ~ treatment', data=df).fit()\nprobit_summary = probit_model.summary()\n\nprobit_summary.tables[1]\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoef\nstd err\nz\nP&gt;|z|\n[0.025\n0.975]\n\n\nIntercept\n-2.1001\n0.023\n-90.073\n0.000\n-2.146\n-2.054\n\n\ntreatment\n0.0868\n0.028\n3.113\n0.002\n0.032\n0.141\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('karlan_list_2007.dta')\n# Filter only treatment group (exclude control group)\ntreatment_df = df[df['treatment'] == 1]\n# Convert ratio values into clearer string labels for matching\n# Filter for the three match treatment groups\nmatch_df = treatment_df[treatment_df['ratio'].isin([1, 2, 3])].copy()\nmatch_df['ratio_label'] = match_df['ratio'].map({1: '1:1', 2: '2:1', 3: '3:1'})\n\n# Get donation indicators for each ratio\ngave_1to1 = match_df[match_df['ratio_label'] == '1:1']['gave']\ngave_2to1 = match_df[match_df['ratio_label'] == '2:1']['gave']\ngave_3to1 = match_df[match_df['ratio_label'] == '3:1']['gave']\n\n# Run pairwise t-tests again\nttest_2v1 = ttest_ind(gave_2to1, gave_1to1)\nttest_3v1 = ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_1to1)\nttest_3v2 = ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_2to1)\n\nttest_2v1, ttest_3v1, ttest_3v2\n\nprint(\"| Comparison | t-stat | p-value |\")\nprint(\"|------------|--------|---------|\")\nprint(f\"| 2:1 vs 1:1 | {ttest_2v1.statistic:.3f} | {ttest_2v1.pvalue:.4f} |\")\nprint(f\"| 3:1 vs 1:1 | {ttest_3v1.statistic:.3f} | {ttest_3v1.pvalue:.4f} |\")\nprint(f\"| 3:1 vs 2:1 | {ttest_3v2.statistic:.3f} | {ttest_3v2.pvalue:.4f} |\")\n\n| Comparison | t-stat | p-value |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| 2:1 vs 1:1 | 0.965 | 0.3345 |\n| 3:1 vs 1:1 | 1.015 | 0.3101 |\n| 3:1 vs 2:1 | 0.050 | 0.9600 |\n\n\nTo assess whether higher match ratios lead to greater likelihood of giving, I compared donation rates across the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 match treatments using a series of t-tests.\nThe results reveal no statistically significant differences in giving between any of the match ratios. For example, the comparison between 2:1 and 1:1 yields a p-value of 0.335, and between 3:1 and 1:1 yields a p-value of 0.310. These findings confirm the authors’ statement that while figures suggest a possible trend, “larger match ratios had no additional impact” on donation probability. In short, more generous matching offers do not necessarily increase participation—perhaps because the mere presence of a match, not its size, is what matters psychologically.\nTo complement the earlier t-test analysis, I ran two regression models to estimate the impact of different match ratios on the probability of donation. In the first model, I created dummy variables for 2:1 and 3:1 ratios, using 1:1 as the baseline. In the second model, I used the categorical match ratio variable directly.Both regressions show that the coefficients for 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios are positive but small and not statistically significant (p-values ≈ 0.31–0.34). This confirms the earlier result: increasing the generosity of the match ratio does not meaningfully increase the probability of donation.\nThese results reinforce the idea that it is the presence of a match—not its size—that matters most to potential donors.\nTo complement the t-tests, I assessed the effect of different match ratios on donation probability using regression analysis. First, I created dummy variables for each match ratio:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('karlan_list_2007.dta')\n# Prepare a clean copy of treatment-only observations with valid ratios\nmatch_df = df[(df['treatment'] == 1) & (df['ratio'].isin([1, 2, 3]))].copy()\n\n# Convert to string for labeling\nmatch_df['ratio_str'] = match_df['ratio'].astype(str)\nmatch_df['ratio_label'] = match_df['ratio_str'].map({'1': '1:1', '2': '2:1', '3': '3:1'})\n\n# Create dummy variables\nmatch_df['ratio1'] = (match_df['ratio_label'] == '1:1').astype(int)\nmatch_df['ratio2'] = (match_df['ratio_label'] == '2:1').astype(int)\nmatch_df['ratio3'] = (match_df['ratio_label'] == '3:1').astype(int)\n\n# Run regression: gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3 (1:1 as baseline)\nreg1 = smf.ols('gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3', data=match_df).fit()\n\n# Alternative: using the ratio_label as a categorical variable\nreg2 = smf.ols('gave ~ C(ratio_label)', data=match_df).fit()\n\nreg1.summary().tables[1], reg2.summary().tables[1]\n\nprint(\"| Variable | Coef. | Std.

Err | t-stat | p-value |\")\nprint(\"|-----------|---------|----------|--------|---------|\")\nprint(f\"| Treatment | {coef:.4f} | {se:.4f}   | {tval:.3f}  | {pval:.4f}  |\")\n\n\n| Variable  | Coef.   | Std. Err | t-stat | p-value |\n|-----------|---------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Treatment | 0.1536 | 0.0826   | 1.861  | 0.0628  |\n\n\nTo examine whether matched donations influence the size of charitable contributions, I compared the average donation amounts between the treatment and control groups.\nA t-test finds that individuals in the treatment group gave, on average, $0.15 more than those in the control group, but this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p ≈ 0.063). A simple bivariate regression of donation amount on treatment status yields the same estimate and confirms the same level of weak significance.\nThese results suggest that the presence of a match may slightly increase how much people give, but the effect is small and not strongly statistically supported.\nTo further explore the impact of matched donations, I re-ran the analysis on only those individuals who made a donation.

This introduces selection bias. The treatment may have influenced both the likelihood of giving and the type of person who decides to give, thus confounding this estimate.\nInterpretation This analysis shows that matched donations do not increase the size of contributions among those who donate.

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."
