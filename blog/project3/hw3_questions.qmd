This assignment expores two methods for estimating the MNL model: (1) via Maximum Likelihood, and (2) via a Bayesian approach using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. 


## 1. Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model

Suppose we have $i=1,\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \in \{1, \ldots, J\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 3 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, brand, price, etc.). 

We model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:

$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\beta + \epsilon_{ij} $$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. 

The choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(j) = \frac{e^{x_j'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

For example, if there are 3 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{e^{x_1'\beta} + e^{x_2'\beta} + e^{x_3'\beta}} $$

A clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\delta_{i1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\delta_{iJ}}$$

Notice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\delta_{i1}=\delta_{i2}=0$ and the likelihood is:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 = \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^3e^{x_k'\beta}} $$

The joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:

$$ L_n(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} $$

And the joint log-likelihood function is:

$$ \ell_n(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_{ij} \log(\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$



## 2. Simulate Conjoint Data

We will simulate data from a conjoint experiment about video content streaming services. We elect to simulate 100 respondents, each completing 10 choice tasks, where they choose from three alternatives per task. For simplicity, there is not a "no choice" option; each simulated respondent must select one of the 3 alternatives. 

Each alternative is a hypothetical streaming offer consistent of three attributes: (1) brand is either Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu; (2) ads can either be part of the experience, or it can be ad-free, and (3) price per month ranges from \$4 to \$32 in increments of \$4.

The part-worths (ie, preference weights or beta parameters) for the attribute levels will be 1.0 for Netflix, 0.5 for Amazon Prime (with 0 for Hulu as the reference brand); -0.8 for included adverstisements (0 for ad-free); and -0.1*price so that utility to consumer $i$ for hypothethical streaming service $j$ is 

$$
u_{ij} = (1 \times Netflix_j) + (0.5 \times Prime_j) + (-0.8*Ads_j) - 0.1\times Price_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where the variables are binary indicators and $\varepsilon$ is Type 1 Extreme Value (ie, Gumble) distributed.

The following code provides the simulation of the conjoint data.

:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
```{r}
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# define attributes
brand <- c("N", "P", "H") # Netflix, Prime, Hulu
ad <- c("Yes", "No")
price <- seq(8, 32, by=4)

# generate all possible profiles
profiles <- expand.grid(
    brand = brand,
    ad = ad,
    price = price
)
m <- nrow(profiles)

# assign part-worth utilities (true parameters)
b_util <- c(N = 1.0, P = 0.5, H = 0)
a_util <- c(Yes = -0.8, No = 0.0)
p_util <- function(p) -0.1 * p

# number of respondents, choice tasks, and alternatives per task
n_peeps <- 100
n_tasks <- 10
n_alts <- 3

# function to simulate one respondent’s data
sim_one <- function(id) {
  
    datlist <- list()
    
    # loop over choice tasks
    for (t in 1:n_tasks) {
        
        # randomly sample 3 alts (better practice would be to use a design)
        dat <- cbind(resp=id, task=t, profiles[sample(m, size=n_alts), ])
        
        # compute deterministic portion of utility
        dat$v <- b_util[dat$brand] + a_util[dat$ad] + p_util(dat$price) |> round(10)
        
        # add Gumbel noise (Type I extreme value)
        dat$e <- -log(-log(runif(n_alts)))
        dat$u <- dat$v + dat$e
        
        # identify chosen alternative
        dat$choice <- as.integer(dat$u == max(dat$u))
        
        # store task
        datlist[[t]] <- dat
    }
    
    # combine all tasks for one respondent
    do.call(rbind, datlist)
}

# simulate data for all respondents
conjoint_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:n_peeps, sim_one))

# remove values unobservable to the researcher
conjoint_data <- conjoint_data[ , c("resp", "task", "brand", "ad", "price", "choice")]

# clean up
rm(list=setdiff(ls(), "conjoint_data"))
```
::::

This structure ensures that each row corresponds to a product alternative within a task, with all feature values and a flag (choice = 1) indicating whether the alternative was selected. The variables are now ready for use in a multinomial logit likelihood function.

## 3. Preparing the Data for Estimation

The "hard part" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps.  In addition, we need to convert the categorical variables for brand and ads into binary variables.


```{python}

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load simulated conjoint data
conjoint_data = pd.read_csv("conjoint_data.csv")

# One-hot encode categorical variables
X = pd.get_dummies(conjoint_data, columns=["brand", "ad"], drop_first=True)


# Convert IDs and choice flag to integer
for col in ['resp', 'task', 'choice']:
    X[col] = X[col].astype(int)

# Add unique choice set identifier
X['choice_set'] = X['resp'].astype(str) + "_" + X['task'].astype(str)

# Sort for readability (optional)
X = X.sort_values(by=['resp', 'task']).reset_index(drop=True)

# Preview cleaned dataset
X.head()

```



## 4. Estimation via Maximum Likelihood

Using scipy.optimize.minimize, we estimated the four coefficients of the MNL model via Maximum Likelihood. The signs and magnitudes of the estimates are consistent with the true part-worths used during data simulation. For instance, Netflix has the highest utility weight, followed by Prime, and the presence of ads reduces utility. Price has a negative marginal utility as expected. Standard errors and 95% confidence intervals are derived using the inverse of the approximated Hessian.

```{python}

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.special import logsumexp

features = ['brand_N', 'brand_P', 'ad_Yes', 'price']
X_data = X[features].astype(float).values

y_data = X['choice'].astype(int).values

group_ids = X['choice_set'].astype(str).values


def neg_log_likelihood(beta, X, y, group_ids):
    """
    beta: parameter vector (length 4)
    X: (n_obs, n_features)
    y: (n_obs,)  binary indicator (1 if chosen)
    group_ids: choice set ID (same for each set of alternatives)
    """
    Xb = X @ beta
    df = pd.DataFrame({'group': group_ids, 'xb': Xb})
    
    # Compute log-denominator for each group using logsumexp
    denom = df.groupby('group')['xb'].transform(lambda x: logsumexp(x))
    
    log_probs = Xb - denom
    ll = np.sum(y * log_probs)
    
    return -ll  # negative log-likelihood for minimization


init_params = np.zeros(X_data.shape[1])  # e.g. [0, 0, 0, 0]

result = minimize(
    fun=neg_log_likelihood,
    x0=init_params,
    args=(X_data, y_data, group_ids),
    method='BFGS',
    options={'disp': True}
)


beta_hat = result.x
hessian_inv = result.hess_inv  # approx. inverse Hessian
standard_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(hessian_inv))


z_95 = 1.96
lower = beta_hat - z_95 * standard_errors
upper = beta_hat + z_95 * standard_errors


summary_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Coefficient': features,
    'Estimate': beta_hat,
    'Std. Error': standard_errors,
    '95% CI Lower': lower,
    '95% CI Upper': upper
})

summary_df.round(4)
```


## 5. Estimation via Bayesian Methods

We estimate the parameters of the MNL model using Bayesian methods via a custom Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The posterior is constructed by combining:

- The log-likelihood from the MNL model (same as used for MLE)
- Normal priors: 
  - $\beta_{\text{Netflix}}, \beta_{\text{Prime}}, \beta_{\text{Ads}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 5^2)$
  - $\beta_{\text{price}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1^2)$

We use a multivariate normal proposal with independent components:
- $\mathcal{N}(0, 0.05)$ for the binary features
- $\mathcal{N}(0, 0.005)$ for the price coefficient

The MCMC sampler ran for 11,000 iterations, with a burn-in of 1,000. The acceptance rate was approximately **56%**, indicating good mixing.

Posterior trace plots and histograms show convergence and unimodality. The posterior means and credible intervals align closely with the MLE estimates and the true data-generating process.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.special import logsumexp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Prepare data
X_data = X[['brand_N', 'brand_P', 'ad_Yes', 'price']].astype(float).values
y_data = X['choice'].astype(int).values
group_ids = X['choice_set'].astype(str).values
```


```{python}

# Log-prior: N(0, 5^2) for binaries; N(0, 1^2) for price
def log_prior(beta):
    lp = -0.5 * (beta[0:3]**2 / 25).sum()  # binary features
    lp += -0.5 * (beta[3]**2 / 1)          # price
    return lp

# Posterior = log-likelihood + log-prior
def log_posterior(beta):
    return -neg_log_likelihood(beta, X_data, y_data, group_ids) + log_prior(beta)

```

```{python}

# Metropolis-Hastings sampler with fixed proposal sd
def metropolis_sampler(log_post_fn, start, steps=11000, proposal_sd=None):
    if proposal_sd is None:
        proposal_sd = np.array([0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005]) 

    draws = np.zeros((steps, len(start)))
    draws[0] = start
    current_lp = log_post_fn(start)

    for t in range(1, steps):
        proposal = draws[t - 1] + np.random.normal(0, proposal_sd)
        proposal_lp = log_post_fn(proposal)
        log_accept_ratio = proposal_lp - current_lp

        if np.log(np.random.rand()) < log_accept_ratio:
            draws[t] = proposal
            current_lp = proposal_lp
        else:
            draws[t] = draws[t - 1]

    return draws

```

```{python}

np.random.seed(42)
start_beta = np.zeros(4)

samples = metropolis_sampler(log_posterior, start=start_beta, steps=11000)
posterior = samples[1000:]  # burn-in

# Acceptance rate
accepted = np.sum(np.any(samples[1:] != samples[:-1], axis=1))
accept_rate = accepted / (samples.shape[0] - 1)
print(f"Acceptance rate: {accept_rate:.3f}")

```

```

### Report
```{python}

#| echo: true
summary = pd.DataFrame({
    'Parameter': ['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ads', 'Price'],
    'Mean': posterior.mean(axis=0),
    'Std': posterior.std(axis=0),
    '2.5%': np.percentile(posterior, 2.5, axis=0),
    '97.5%': np.percentile(posterior, 97.5, axis=0)
}).round(4)

summary
```

### Comparison and Conclusion

The results from both Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian inference (via Metropolis-Hastings) are remarkably consistent across all four parameters. The point estimates are nearly identical, and the credible intervals from the Bayesian method align closely with the confidence intervals from the frequentist approach.

This agreement confirms the robustness of the modeling setup and the quality of the simulated data. Bayesian methods offer additional benefits such as full posterior distributions and the ability to quantify uncertainty without relying on asymptotic approximations.

Overall:
- Netflix and Prime have positive utility, with Netflix being stronger.
- Ad inclusion decreases utility substantially.
- Higher price reduces the likelihood of selection, with the negative effect precisely estimated.

The Bayesian method provides a powerful complement to MLE, and both approaches support the same substantive conclusions about consumer preference structure.


## 6. Discussion

### Interpreting Parameter Estimates in Real-World Contexts
If we did not simulate the data and instead received this dataset from a real-world conjoint study, we would interpret the estimated coefficients as reflecting underlying consumer preferences inferred from choice behavior.

The fact that $\beta_{\text{Netflix}} > \beta_{\text{Prime}}$ suggests that, holding all else equal (ads and price), consumers derive more utility from Netflix than Prime. This likely reflects a stronger brand perception, broader content library, or past satisfaction with Netflix.

The negative sign of $\beta_{\text{price}}$ is intuitive and economically meaningful: higher prices reduce the likelihood of a product being chosen, all else equal. The size of this coefficient reflects the marginal disutility per dollar increase.

Similarly, the negative coefficient for ads indicates a strong consumer preference for ad-free viewing experiences. This supports strategic decisions to offer premium, ad-free tiers for higher willingness-to-pay segments.

Overall, even without knowledge of the simulation, the parameter estimates align with expected market dynamics. The model captures realistic trade-offs and can inform pricing, positioning, and product bundling strategies.



### Moving Toward Hierarchical (Random-Parameter) MNL Models


To simulate and estimate a **hierarchical or multi-level MNL model**, we would need to introduce **individual-level heterogeneity** in the part-worth utilities. In the standard MNL model, all consumers are assumed to share the same coefficients (fixed $\beta$). However, in the real world, consumer preferences vary—some may value price sensitivity more, others may strongly prefer ad-free experiences.

#### To simulate hierarchical data:
- Instead of drawing one global $\beta$ for all consumers, we would:
  - First specify a **population-level distribution** for each coefficient, e.g., $\beta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$
  - For each respondent $i$, draw an individual-specific $\beta_i$ from this distribution
  - Then use $\beta_i$ to simulate their choices across tasks
  - This introduces **respondent-level variation** in preferences

#### To estimate such a model:
- We must infer both:
  - The distribution of coefficients (hyperparameters $\mu$, $\Sigma$),
  - And the individual-level coefficients $\beta_i$ themselves
- This typically requires **Bayesian hierarchical modeling** using MCMC (e.g., Gibbs or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo), or **frequentist approaches** like simulated maximum likelihood
- Software such as **Stan, PyMC, or Hierarchical Bayes in R** (e.g., `bayesm`) is often used

#### Why use hierarchical models?
- They allow more accurate modeling of **preference heterogeneity**
- They provide **individual-level estimates** (ideal for personalization)
- They are especially useful when the number of tasks per respondent is small, but the dataset is large overall

In summary, to move from MNL to hierarchical MNL:
- **Simulation**: Add a prior distribution over $\beta_i$
- **Estimation**: Use full Bayesian or simulation-based frequentist methods to recover both population and individual-level parameters
